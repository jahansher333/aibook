# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Learn to build intelligent humanoid robots using **ROS 2**, **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, and **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models. This comprehensive textbook takes you from fundamentals to advanced capstone projects.

## What You'll Learn

This 13-chapter course covers the complete stack of Physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- 🤖 **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Nodes, topics, services, actions, and launch files
- 🎮 **Simulation Environments**: Gazebo Harmonic, Unity ML-Agents, NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- 🦾 **Humanoid Robotics**: Kinematics, locomotion, manipulation, and whole-body control
- 🧠 **AI Integration**: Vision-Language-Action models with Whisper, GPT-4, and CLIP
- 🔧 **Hardware Deployment**: Jetson Orin Nano, RealSense D435i sensors, sim-to-real transfer

## Course Structure

### 13 Weeks of Hands-On Learning

Each chapter follows a proven pedagogical structure:

1. **Learning Objectives** - Clear, measurable outcomes aligned with assessments
2. **Theory** - Conceptual foundations with diagrams and cited references
3. **Hands-on Lab** - Executable code examples for simulation and hardware
4. **Assessment** - Interactive MCQ quizzes to validate understanding

### Progressive Difficulty

- **Weeks 1-3**: Foundations (Physical AI concepts, ROS 2 basics, robot modeling)
- **Weeks 4-6**: Simulation (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim environments)
- **Weeks 7-9**: Advanced AI (VLA models, kinematics, locomotion)
- **Weeks 10-12**: Integration (Manipulation, conversational AI, hardware deployment)
- **Week 13**: Capstone project (voice-command autonomous humanoid)

## Hardware Options

Choose a tier that fits your budget and learning goals:

| Tier       | Cost            | Best For                          |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Economy**| ~$700 one-time  | Solo learners, students           |
| **Proxy**  | ~$3,850 one-time| Research labs, institutions       |
| **Cloud**  | ~$205/quarter   | Remote learners, cloud-first      |
